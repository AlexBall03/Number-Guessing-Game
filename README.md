# Hello World!

## This is a number guessing game. The goal is to think of a number between 1 and 100, then the computer will try to guess the number before the limit of 7 turns is up.

#### For now, this will be strictly based on a YouTube video. Over time, I will make my own changes as I learn.  Later in the future, I'll make it so that you can choose how many turns you have and the number range. And hopefully even more advanced!                                     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wHXNMRwBMg&list=PLBhJnyA0V0uKvZP6j1JMPjUUX9PwPvKhR&index=6

## Thank you!
